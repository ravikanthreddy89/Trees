This is a practice implementation which I implemented during Winter break. I did all I can to make it as smooth as possible to understand
the code. I've included terminal session recording my testing. Please forgive me if it causes any inconvenience and I would really appreciate any feed back. Thank you. 

Classes and their roles 
======================================

BinaryTree : ****************Please take a look at this file, I've included some figures.************
             The core class that implements BinarySearchTree and all other functions.
             
Node 	   : Class that defines a node in binary search tree.

Test2	   : A class to test the binary search tree(with key of type "Integer" and value of type "String") 
             manually with commands. Once you run this class it prints commands and what they do.

TestCases2 : Contains two test cases I used to test the implementation.

typescript : A small terminal session of my testing captured with script command. I used the tree shown below.
